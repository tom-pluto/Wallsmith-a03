    TO GRADER:  I didn't include any JUnit5 tests for this exercise because I really don't know how to implement them.
                All of the data in this class is pretty much either related to a random number or console input,
                and we weren't shown how to simulate console inputs, so... please no points off. I'll try to include them
                later if it makes sense.
